	// To simulate real movement we need to interpolate between
	// The players current position to the next point to look.
	//
	// The premise is that if there is a point to look around, 
	// The player must have been next to that point earlier (by
	// definition of the algorithm) so if we keep track of where
	// the player has been we can back track our steps to reach
	// the desired point.

	// plan your backtracking algorithm.
